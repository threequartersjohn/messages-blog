        Today i had a strange dream... it was about a friend i haven't seen in
        ages. To be honest... we're not really friends anymore! But in my dream
        we were still friends.</message-post

      <message-post
        >But it was so strange because it was on my smartphone and it felt like
        i was looking right into her bedroom while she was talking! I suppose it
        was a video but... i guess in my dreams it didn't register as a
        video.</message-post

      <message-post
        >What a strange experience. And she wasn't wearing a lot of clothes. I
        think in my dream i was somehow aware that people didn't wear a lot of
        clothes in general. But it felt creepy anyway. I woke up right
        after!</message-post

      <message-post
        >I felt very outside of the whole thing. Like i didn't belong! Like i
        don't know why these people wear so little, i want to be dressed, i
        don't want to be like them.</message-post

      <message-post>Well that was it. My dreams are strange...</message-post>
