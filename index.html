          One time i was having a walk and i saw two birds. The birds were flying very low. It was a black bird and a red bird. I don't know their names but they were pretty birds.

          I work as a software developer and i have been doing so since 2019. That was before the pandemic. The pandemic was very strange, but i worked through the whole thing, since my work can be done remotely very easily.

          I'm trying out web components so that one day i'll be able to make websites that are big and complex but don't need any frameworks! But this only works for static websites i think... i would need things like state to make applications.
