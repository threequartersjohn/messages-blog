          Web components are very cool. Seems like it could take some years before they are well and nice across all browser providers though.

          Hopefully we'll move beyond JS frameworks for smaller projects with kind of tech!

          One time i was having a walk and i saw two birds. The birds were flying very low. It was a black bird and a red bird. I don't know their names but they were pretty birds.

          I work as a software developer and i have been doing so since 2019. That was before the pandemic. The pandemic was very strange, but i worked through the whole thing, since my work can be done remotely very easily.

          I'm trying out web components so that one day i'll be able to make websites that are big and complex but don't need any frameworks! But this only works for static websites i think... i would need things like state to make applications.

          Hey! My name is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://threequartersjohn.github.io/">Jo√£o Silva</a> and this is a small project to experiment with web components.
        </p>

        <p>
          I chose a blog structure because i was inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dzrgo.com">Dul Zorigoo's website</a> and wanted to try doing something similar.

          ‚ö†Ô∏è This will probably not work very well in Safari. Safari's Intersection Observer behavior is non-standard and is causing some issues.
